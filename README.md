# Aggregate Functions and Grouping – Employee Database
# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL aggregate functions and grouping operations on an example Employee Database.
It covers calculating totals, averages, counts, maximum and minimum values, grouping data, and filtering grouped results using the HAVING clause.

# Database & Table Structure
Database: COMPANY_DB
Table: EMPLOYEES

# Columns:

- EMP_ID – Unique employee ID (Primary Key)

- EMP_NAME – Full name of the employee

- DEPARTMENT – Department name

- SALARY – Monthly salary

- LOCATION – Work location

- HIRE_DATE – Date of joining

# Sample Data Description
The table contains six employees from different departments and locations, each with varying salaries and hire dates. This dataset is used to demonstrate aggregation and grouping queries.

Concepts Demonstrated
- SUM – Calculate the total salary of all employees.

- AVG – Find the average salary for the entire table or per location.

- COUNT – Count the total number of employees or number of employees per department.

- MAX – Retrieve the highest salary overall or within each department.

- MIN – Retrieve the lowest salary in the table.

- GROUP BY – Group data by department or location to perform aggregate calculations on each group.

- HAVING – Filter grouped results based on aggregate values, such as showing departments with a total salary above a certain amount.
